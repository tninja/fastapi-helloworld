## 经文全文

### 马太福音 6:25-34 (NIV)
25 “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?  
26 Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?  
27 Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?  
28 “And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin.  
29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.  
30 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith?  
31 So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’  
32 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.  
33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.  
34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

### 诗篇 46 (NIV)
1 God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.  
2 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea,  
3 though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.  
4 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells.  
5 God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day.  
6 Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall; he lifts his voice, the earth melts.  
7 The LORD Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.  
8 Come and see what the LORD has done, the desolations he has brought on the earth.  
9 He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth. He breaks the bow and shatters the spear; he burns the shields with fire.  
10 He says, “Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.”  
11 The LORD Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.

## 经文解释

这些经文提醒我们，神是我们生活中的避难所和力量。马太福音6章告诉我们，忧虑不能增加生命的长度，相反，它可能会减少我们的喜乐和信心。耶稣鼓励我们信靠天父，因为祂知道我们的需要，并且祂必供应。诗篇46则告诉我们，在动荡不安的世界中，神是我们永远的避难所，即使在最严峻的危机中，祂仍然同在。

## 实用应用

在今天的科技和工作环境中，AI的快速发展可能让我们感到不安，担心工作机会的减少或技能过时。然而，耶稣的话语提醒我们，不必为这些世俗的忧虑焦虑。我们被召去首先追求神的国度和公义，信靠祂会供应我们的需要。我们可以通过提升自我技能并积极适应新环境来应对这些变化，但最终，我们要把焦虑交托给神，因为祂是我们的避难所。

## 祷告

亲爱的天父，感谢祢在我们生活中的同在和引导。当我们面临工作和技术的变化时，求祢帮助我们不被焦虑所困，教导我们信靠祢的供应和计划。求祢赐给我们智慧和力量，使我们能在变化中保持平安，并以信心面对未来。奉主耶稣基督的名祷告，阿们。
